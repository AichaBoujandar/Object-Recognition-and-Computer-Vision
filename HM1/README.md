## Instance-level recognition
The goal of instance-level recognition is to match (recognize) a specific object orscene.  Examples include recognizing a specific building, such as Notre Dame, ora specific painting, such as ‘Starry Night’ by Van Gogh. The object is recognizeddespite changes in scale, camera viewpoint, illumination conditions and partialocclusion.  An important application is image retrieval - starting from an imageof an object of interest (the query), search through an image dataset to obtain(or retrieve) those images that contain the target object.  The goal of this assign-ment is to experiment and get basic practical experience with the methods thatenable specific object recognition.  It includes:  (i) using SIFT features to obtainsparse  matches  between  two  images;  (ii)  using  similarity  co-variant  detectorsto cover changes in viewpoint; (iii) vector quantizing the SIFT descriptors intovisual words to enable large scale retrieval; and (iv) constructing and using animage retrieval system to identify objects
