## Neural Networks

The goal of this assignment is to get basic knowledge and hands-on experiencewith training and using neural networks.  In Part 1 of the assignment we imple-mented and experimented with the training and testing of a simple two layerfully-connected neural network.  In Part 2 we learnt about convolutional neuralnetworks, their motivation, building blocks, and how they are trained.  Finally,in part 3 we trained a CNN for classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset.
