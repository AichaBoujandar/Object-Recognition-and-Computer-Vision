## Classification using transfer learning

The Kaggle competition ”Object recognition and computer vision 2019/2020”consists on producing the model that gives the best accuracy on a test datasetcontaining  the  same  categories  as  a  subset  of  Caltech-UCSD  Birds-2002011dataset.  Since the images contained in this dataset overlap with the ImageNetdataset, I have used the transfer learning approach with the pretrained models available in Pytorch to produce the classification model.
